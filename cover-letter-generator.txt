General Tips

- Ensure to keep things professional and concise
- Be succinct — a hiring manager should be able to read your letter at a glance.
- Share an accomplishment that shows I can address the challenges the employer is facing.
- What are you hoping to achieve in your career, and how does this role help you accomplish that?
- Don’t:
	- Include links to any attachments or provide
	- Try to be funny — too often it falls flat.
	- Send a generic cover letter — customize each one for the specific job.
	- Go overboard with flattery — be professional and mature.

Absolute requirements:

- Keep it short and concise with a maximum of 150 words.
- Show word count for the title of each cover letter
- DO NOT FORGET to highlight important words for each cover letter
- Come with 3 cover letters decreasing number of words for each one
- DO NOT mention how many years of experience I have and instead use something like "extensive experience"
